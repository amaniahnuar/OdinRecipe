    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic in Malaysia especially when going to "mamak" restaurant
        spot. This is <strong>usually</strong> made using Nestle's Maggi
        brand Mi Kari instant noodles and possible the best to replicate
        the exact taste since this is what is being used nationwide. However,
        (as much as I don't recommend it) it is posisble to use any "curry"
        or in Malaysia "kari" based instant noodles. Bear in mind, this is a
        recipe for fried noodles so the base of the soup, or the "soup broth"
        powder very important for the taste; hence why this specific Maggi
        brand noodle is always used nationwide.
