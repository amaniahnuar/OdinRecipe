    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a super special dish. It is far from perfect and definitely
        going to look goofy or just plain stupid for including in this list.
        But, I am including because the most important person in my life once
        made this and it was the warmest food I got to experience admist of
        the chaos I was going through that year-2024. A thai dish that is super
        simple, almost beggar-type food, yet is just as flavorful as any Asian
        dish that we all know for!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For the Pad Kra Pao:
        <ul>
            <li>300g ground chicken, pork, or beef</li>
            <li>4-5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2-3 Thai birdâ€™s eye chilies, chopped (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dark soy sauce (optional, for color)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 handful fresh Thai holy basil leaves (if unavailable, Thai basil can work as a substitute)</li>
        </ul>
        For the Sunny-Side-Up Egg:
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (enough for shallow frying)</li>
        </ul>
        To Serve:
        <ul>
            <li>Steamed jasmine rice</li>
        </ul>    
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince garlic and chilies together to form a rough paste.</li>
            <li>Wash and pick the basil leaves, discarding the stems.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a wok or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and chili paste, stirring quickly to release the aroma (about 30 seconds).</li>
            <li>Add the ground meat and stir-fry until fully cooked, breaking up clumps with your spatula.</li>
            <li>Add oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, dark soy sauce (if using), and sugar. Stir well to coat the meat.</li>
            <li>Toss in the basil leaves and stir just until they wilt. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat enough oil in a separate pan over medium-high heat to shallow fry.</li>
            <li>Crack an egg directly into the hot oil and fry until the edges are crispy and the yolk is still runny (about 1-2 minutes). Repeat for the second egg.</li>
            <li>Spoon the Pad Kra Pao over a plate of steamed jasmine rice and top with the crispy fried egg.</li>
        </ol>
